This repository includes tools to analyze delta B contributions to the earth's total magnetic field.  In the initial version, it is examining the div_simple1 data.  The two major components are:

1. compare_data.py that compares the calculations done with Paraview and those done with Python.  The results should be equivalent, and they are are.  This is a double-check of our calculations.

2. deltaB_plots.py that slices and dices the data in various ways to identify patterns in the results.
